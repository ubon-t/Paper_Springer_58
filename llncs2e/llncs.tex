\section{Introduction}
%
Automobile License Plate Recognition (ALPR) becomes an important trend in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) \cite{Ronak}.
%%
Basically, the license plate is a unique ID for a vehicle that can be used for automatic vehicle recognition system by reading license plates from photos or video recorded.
%%
In addition, license plate recognition (LPR) has been widely applied in numerous applications.
%
For example, the LPR system can be used in smart border safety \cite{kaza} to monitor vehicles entering and leaving the country, recording license plates with a location and date and time of entry using license plate readers.
%% 
These records are used to match the vehicle watch lists to detect the target vehicles crossing the border.
%%
In addition to that, LPR can be used in smart parking areas or smart toll stations to help facilitate the vehicles bearing authorized license plates that the gates is opened when the vehicles have authorization \cite{AshtariITS}.
%%
The intellectualized traffic management \cite{ShengITS} and traffic safety enforcement \cite{Bailey} also use LPR to implementing the processes.
%%
Furthermore, the security control of restricted areas \cite{AdorniLPR} can
improve the intruder prevention capability by using LPR to detect license plates authorization.
%%

For the vehicle recognition method, there are several methods such as vehicle type recognition,  vehicle color recognition,  vehicle brand recognition, and vehicle model recognition to help facilitate the vehicle detection process \cite{kaza,AshtariITS,ShengITS,Bailey,AdorniLPR,ZezhiChen,Friedman,Stauffer,Hsieh}.
%5
However, the suspect vehicle detection by only vehicle recognition previously mentioned to detect the criminal/suspect vehicles may be insufficient.
%
Normally, the suspect vehicle detection system compares the list of blacklisted license plates from the checkpoint database and vehicle license plates gathering from LPR method to identify the criminal/suspect vehicles.
%
This traditional process of comparing those license plates utilizing the matching of alphabet character is not effective.
%
The system unable to detect the criminal/suspect vehicles with forged license plate if the characters of the license plate do not totally match with the blacklisted license plates.

In this paper, we propose an approach includes two techniques to detect the criminal/suspect vehicles that crossing the checkpoint.
%
In the first technique, we use reputation algorithm to detect the criminal/suspect vehicles that crossing the checkpoint which license plates from ALPR match with the blacklist in the checkpoint database.
%
Reputation concept is a technique to classify object that commonly applied to various systems to make effective automatic detection, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication \cite{QinLi,Dhurandher,Ayday}, filtering email spam \cite{Xie,Chirita:Mailrank,West:Spam,Zhang:Ipgrouprep},E-commerce \cite{altman,page,WangLin}, etc.
%
The vehicle detection by only data classification process may be insufficient. Therefore, the association analysis process should be used together to increase the detection accuracy.
%
In the second technique, we use association analysis concept to detect the suspect vehicles which license plates do not match the blacklist.
%
However, this method uses color, brand and type of vehicles obtained from the vehicle recognition previously mentioned matching the blacklist to identify the vehicles crossing the checkpoint that might relate to the criminal activity records.
%
We consider the involvement in criminal activities by analyzing the vehicles already crossed the checkpoint near the location, date, and time of the criminal activities records.
%
Our two techniques can detect the suspect vehicles with forged license plate by using color, brand and type of the vehicles instead of only the license plate number matching method.
%
A blacklist of criminal vehicles and criminal activity recorded obtain from a criminal report database of Defence Technology Institute (DTI), Thailand.
%
The aim of this work is to improve the detection capability of the suspect vehicle detection system.

In the next section, we will discuss the background information and previous studies
using reputation algorithm and association analysis concept. 
%
Section 3 explains the research testbed and research design. 
%
Experimental results are shown in Section 4, and discussed in Section 5. 
%
Section 6 concludes and presents future directions.

\section{Literature Review}
%
The literature reviews of related our research are divided into following subsections.
%
\subsection{The Vehicle Recognition and Detection}
%
There are several research works about efficient vehicle detection and classification. 
%
For example, Chen et al. \cite{ZezhiChen} propose two processes to devide moving road vehicles and classify those vehicles in terms of type (car, van and heavy goods vehicle) and dominant colour (black, white, red).
%
For the segmentation, they have improved the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach proposed by Friedman and Russell \cite{Friedman} and refined for real-time tracking by Stauffer and Grimson \cite{Stauffer} with a multi-dimensional smoothing transform.
%
For vehicle classification \cite{ZezhiChen}, they use a kernelised support vector machine (SVM) to classify vehicle types and colours.
%
The classification process uses size, width, aspect ratio and solidity of the foreground vehicle to recognise vehicle type and uses 8-bin 3D colour histogram as the vector for SVM classification to recognise vehicle colour. 
%
Hsieh et al. \cite{Hsieh} propose a new symmetrical Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptor applied to vehicle make and model recognition (MMR) system to detect vehicles and recognize their make and model.

In the field of suspect vehicle detection, Kaza and Chen \cite{kaza:suspectVehicle} research the border safety to help Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents , USA, to search for the vehicles entering the country at land borders that potentially involved in criminal activity.
%
They can identify the criminal/suspect vehicles and other partner vehicles that crossing together and potentially involved in criminal activities. 
%
This literature review uses association analysis by using mutual information (MI) and modifies the MI formulation to incorporate domain heuristics by using cross-jurisdictional criminal data from border-area jurisdictions.
%
The heuristic-enhanced MI performs significantly batter than classical MI \cite{kaza} in identifying partner of potentially criminal/suspect vehicles.
%
Umedu et al. \cite{Umedu} proposed the dangerous-vehicle-detection protocol (DVDP) to detect dangerous vehicles on roads and highways that violate the permitted speed limit.
%
In DVDP, they use ad hoc communications to forward hop-by-hop warning information (including its position, speed, time, and collected IDs). 
%
When a vehicle receives warning information, it will start to observe its surrounding vehicle and it is estimated the speed. 
%
If the estimation speed exceeds the permitted speed, such vehicle is considered as a suspected vehicles and the updated warning information is then further propagated to vehicles ahead. 
%
The suspected vehicle will be considered as a dangerous vehicle by the suspected vehicle where multiple other vehicles witnessed the speed violation.
%
Kaza et al. \cite{kaza:TopologicalAnalysis} uses the combination analysis of law enforcement information and data generated by vehicle license plate readers at international borders to identify suspicious vehicles and people at ports of entry.
%
They analyze the topological characteristics of criminal activity networks (CANs) of individuals and vehicles in a multiple jurisdiction scenario. 
%
The vehicular relationships and border-crossing information can aid in securing the border and transportation infrastructure. 
%
Furthermore, Thiel \cite{Thiel} uses the VIRTUAL GUARD system for detecting potential criminal activity in public areas. 
%
This system will be alarmed when the observed activities of particular vehicles and pedestrians match any of the pre-defined suspect behavior criteria programmed into the system. 
%
In addition, the system uses computer-controlled Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) cameras to obtain close-up video recordings of any vehicles and pedestrians at the scene.

Although the above proposals are useful for vehicle detection to identify the suspect vehicle, we focus on the detection of suspect vehicles with forged license plate. 
%
Therefore, we review the studies about reputation algorithm and association analysis concept which we will discuss in the next subsection.

\subsection{Reputation Algorithm}
The concept of reputation has been used to classify objects in a domain or community. 
%
An object with a higher reputation score gain more attraction than an object with a lower reputation score. 
% 
Reputation concept has been applied to the several problems in vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. 
% 
In \cite{QinLi}, it works well for allowing evaluation of message reliability in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) environments. 
%
If the vehicle that generates this message has a sufficiently high reputation, a message is considered reliable.
%
Dhurandher et al. \cite{Dhurandher} propose vehicular security to detect and isolate malicious nodes in VANET.
%
Ayday et al. \cite{Ayday} develop the Iterative Trust and Reputation Mechanism (ITRM) for DELAY-TOLERANT Networks (DTNs) which enables every node to evaluate other nodes based on their past behavior.
%
The ITRM takes advantage of an iterative mechanism to detect and isolate the malicious nodes from the network even in the presence of the attacks on the trust and detection mechanisms.

The reputation concept can also be applied to other practical applications. 
%
For example, Xie and Wang \cite{Xie} present a Collaboration-based Autonomous email REputation (CARE) system to rate both spam domains and nonspam domains in an autonomous manner.
% 
Altman and Tennenholtz \cite{altman} uses the axiomatic approach to deal PageRank, the most famous page ranking algorithm.

We propose the use of this concept to identify criminal vehicles that crossing the checkpoint. 
%
A high reputation score represents a criminal vehicle, whereas low reputation score represents a normal vehicle.

\subsection{Association Analysis Concept}
Association analysis concept has been widely applied in various systems in previous research.
For example, the concept of mutual information have been used to estimate word association norms between words in English texts \cite{chruch} and to extract a triple of binary strings a, b, c \cite{romashchenko}.
Kaza et al. \cite{kaza} used association analysis by using the concept of mutual information measurement to identify potentially target vehicles that cross the border frequently with the vehicles which are involved in criminal activity.
In addition, association analysis by using the idea of association rule has also been used to automatically detect the ischemic beats in long duration electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings \cite{Exarchos} and to extract valuable industrial data from massive data storage \cite{zhuang}.
G. Miao et al. \cite{miao} used a new ranking algorithm, based on Latent Association Analysis (LAA) by considering
the semantic associations among document pairs to rank target documents using the latent factor.

%
\section{Research Testbed and Design}
%
\subsection{Research Testbed}
The testbed for this research includes the blacklist of the criminal vehicle data set and the criminal activity data set obtained from criminal report database of Defence Technology Institute (DTI), Thailand.
Moreover, this testbed consists of the lists of the checkpoint crossing data set from various sensors includes the license plate, vehicle brand, vehicle color, vehicle type, checkpoint, crossing date and time. The checkpoint crossing data set is divided into two categories: 1) The one year records. 2) The real time checkpoint crossing records in three months. Details of these data sets are shown in Table \ref{table_inputData}.

Figure \ref{fig:diagram} shows the research design and the evolution process of criminal/suspect vehicle detection at the checkpoint. This diagram is divided into three sections: 
1) Input section consists of the real time checkpoint crossing data set in three months, the one year records of checkpoint crossing data set, the blacklist of criminal vehicle data set, and criminal activity data set. 
2) Processing section consists of matching score module to detect the criminal vehicles that crossing the checkpoint and vehicle association with criminal activity score module to detect the suspect vehicles that crossing the checkpoint. In this research, we focus on the processing section shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagram} which is explained in the following sub-sections. 
3) Output section serves as the alert of the criminal vehicle or suspect vehicle if the system detects the criminal vehicles or suspect vehicles that crossing the checkpoint.

%
Matching Score Module is criminal vehicle detection process. 
First, we define attributes for classification and assign weight to each of the attributes. 
Higher weight is assigned to higher significant attributes.
In this research, we select the license plate, vehicle color, vehicle brand, and vehicle type to be used in the classification and we assign higher weight to license plate than vehicle color, vehicle brand, and vehicle type. 
The system compares the real time checkpoint crossing records in three months and criminal vehicle records in the blacklist by using following attributes: license plate, vehicle color, vehicle brand, and vehicle type. 
Subsequently, it computes the sum of all of the weighted attribute. 
The weighted sum is a single number to compare with the threshold.  
If weighted sum is greater than the high score threshold, referred to as High Matching Score, vehicle crossing the checkpoint will be considered as criminal vehicle and will be processed in the Alert Module. 
If weighted sum is less than the high score threshold and also greater than the low score threshold, referred to as Middle Matching Score, vehicle crossing the checkpoint will be considered as target vehicle and will be processed in the Vehicle Association with Criminal Activity Score Module. 

High Matching Score is calculated by the following attribute-matching condition: at least license plate matches with the blacklist.
Middle Matching Score is calculated by the following attribute-matching condition: vehicle color and vehicle brand and vehicle type match with the blacklist. 
Algorithm of Matching Score Module is shown in Figure \ref{fig:matchingAlgo}. Table \ref{table_variableMatching} summarizes the notation for Matching Score Module.

\subsubsection{Vehicle Association with Criminal Activity Score Module}
This module is a suspect vehicle detection process using association analysis concept to identify the vehicles that are potentially involved in criminal activities. 
We determine the number of all the one year checkpoint crossing lists of target vehicle by considering the matching of license plate, vehicle color, vehicle brand, and vehicle type. 
Consequently, we analyze the relationship between each of the criminal activity with all the one year checkpoint crossing records of target vehicle, and we further restricted the set to contain only checkpoint crossing records of target vehicle that already crossed the checkpoint near the location, date, and time of criminal activities. 
Such set can be indicated the number of involvement in criminal activities of target vehicle. 
Then we can calculated the association ratio by using in (1) by computing the fraction of number of involvement in criminal activities of target vehicle and number of the checkpoint crossing records of target vehicle to compare with the defined threshold.
\begin{eqnarray} 
\alpha \quad =\quad \frac { \nu  }{ \varsigma  }
\end{eqnarray}
where\mbox{ }\\
$\alpha$ = association ratio. \mbox{ }\\
$\nu$ = number of involvement in criminal activities of target vehicle.\mbox{ }\\
$\varsigma$ = total of the 1 year checkpoint crossing records of target vehicle.\\

If the vehicles with higher ratio than the threshold, they are considered potential suspect vehicles, and then the vehicle data will be processed in the Alert Module. 
Algorithm of Vehicle association with Criminal Activity Score Module is shown in Figure \ref{fig:activityAlgo}. Table \ref{table_variableActivity} summarizes the notation for Vehicle Association with Criminal Activity Score Module.

\section{Experimental Results}
To analyze system performance, there are four factors for analysis as follows:
1) True positive (TP) is the number of the criminal and suspect vehicles that are analyzed as the criminal and suspect vehicles.  
2) True negative (TN) is the number of the normal vehicles that are analyzed as the normal vehicles. 
3) False positive (FP) is the number of the normal vehicles that are analyzed as the criminal and suspect vehicles. 
4) False negative (FN) is the number of the criminal and suspect vehicles that are analyzed as the normal vehicles. 
Such factors can be calculated by using this formula:\\
$$ \text{TP Rate} =  \frac{\text{TrueCSV}}{\text{TofCSV}} $$\\
$$ \text{FN Rate} =  \frac{\text{FalseCSV}}{\text{TofCSV}} $$\\
$$ \text{TN Rate} =  \frac{\text{TrueNV}}{\text{TofNV}} $$\\ 
$$ \text{FP Rate} =  \frac{\text{FalseNV}}{\text{TofNV}} $$\\
$$ \text{Detection Accurate Rate} =  \frac{\text{TP Rate + TN Rate}}{\text{2}} $$

Table \ref{table_variableSysPerf} summarizes the notation for The System Performance Analysis.
The results obtained from the vehicle detection tests in three months is shown in Table \ref{table_vehiclesDetected}.
As a results, this novel process can detect 147 suspect vehicles more than the traditional process or equal to 138.68\% higher.
Figure \ref{fig:graphresults} and Table \ref{table_results} show the results of the system performance analysis of the novel process that have the criminal/suspect vehicle detection rate is equal to 49.32\% and detection accurate rate is equal to 74.09\% which is an acceptable accurate rate. These results show that this technique can improve the detection capability of the suspect vehicle detection process.

\section{Discussion}
The novel process still gain higher FP rate than the traditional process because using only color, brand and type of vehicles matching the blacklist can not separate the normal vehicles out of the target vehicles. However, we intend to improve the normal vehicle separation process by using the target vehicle data from Matching Score Module matching the vehicle database of Department of Land Transport (DLT), Thailand. If the target vehicle data do not match the DLT database, it is considered as the illegal vehicles and processed in the Vehicle Association with Criminal Activity Score Module. In addition, the use of the DLT database can improve the FN rate.

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
This research proposes the use of vehicle reputation in couple with association analysis concept to improve the detection capability of suspect vehicle detection system.
The testing results from the previous section shows that the blacklist of criminal vehicles and criminal activity records obtained from criminal report database of DTI can be used to enhance the detection capability of suspect vehicle detection system and can address the limitations existing in the traditional process. 
In the future work, we plan to test this algorithm with the real scenario to compare with the formula in this research. 
In addition, we intend to explore the behavior of criminal vehicles crossing the checkpoint. This will allow us to analyze the crossing the checkpoint patterns of criminal vehicles and improve the suspect vehicle detection. Additionally, we intend to extend the suspect vehicle detection by using the vehicle crossing the checkpoint matching the vehicle database of DLT. This can be used to detect the illegal vehicles for reducing error of the normal vehicles detected as the suspect vehicles.
